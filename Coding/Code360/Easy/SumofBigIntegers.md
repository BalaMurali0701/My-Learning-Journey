&emsp;&emsp;Hello guys, Welcome here. Today we are going to look at the problem involving BigIntegers, and solve it using c++, Java, and python. Let's don't waste time and get into the problem right away.

*_**Problem Statement:**_*

&emsp;&emsp;You have been given two integers ‘NUM1’ and ‘NUM2’ as a string. Your task is to print the sum of both the numbers.



*_**Understanding the Problem:**_*

&emsp;&emsp;We just need to code the function not the entire input and output stuff they are already taken care of by coding360. now we were given a function named **findSum** with two string passed as parameters.
Those string are only numbers.

**Step 1:** First we need to convert the string into Big Integer so we can do the *_**sum**_* operation on the given two numbers. <br />

**Step 2:** After performing addition convert the Big Integer back into ***String***.<br />

**Step 3:** Return the string.

These steps seems simple and easy. Let's dive into the coding part.
